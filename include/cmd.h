Any number of commands can be added in a frame, from several different sources.
Most commands come from either keybindings or console line input, but remote
servers can also send across commands and entire text files can be execed.

The + command line options are also added to the command buffer.

The game starts with a Cbuf_AddText ("exec quake.rc\n"); Cbuf_Execute ();
